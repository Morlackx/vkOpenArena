A model is a 3D object. Models for OpenArena are usually created with Blender
and then exported to MD3 format. Models can be placed inside maps (for example,
as decorative elements), or it is even possible to work on a map as a model
(see Modelling a map). Models placed inside any official OpenArena map are 
required to have a "source" available and to be released under the GPLv2
(or Public Domain) license, like everything else (see DeveloperFAQ#License).


Another software capable of working with MD3 models should be Misfit Model 3D
(which has got "beta" MD3 support in its "development version"). 
Although it may not provide enough animation control for player models, 
it should be fine at least for static models (mapmodels to be baked into maps). 
That project has been halted, but another developed forked it and continued 
working on it as Maverick Model 3D. It has got improved MD3 support, 
there is a manual page about it here.

From the point of view of the final user, the most interesting kind of models
are the character models, also known as player models, and often simply referred
as models.
