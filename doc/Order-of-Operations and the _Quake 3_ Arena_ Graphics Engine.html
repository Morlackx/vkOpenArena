<p>In July 1998, John Carmack announced further details regarding the <em>Quake 3 : Arena</em> (Q3A)
graphics engine. This article 
attempts to explain recent changes to the Q3A graphics engine while exploring <i>order-of-operations</i>.
 After you're done, you may download all-new files that enable you to 
play with the new features of the Q3A graphics engine in real time using
 Adobe Photoshop.

<p>This article assumes you have read <a href="http://www.bigpanda.com/trinity/article1.html">Multitexture and the Quake 3 Graphics Engine</a> (MATQ3GE).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>Most relevant to our ongoing discussion of multitexture, 
bump-mapping has been dropped from Q3A's list of features due to 
excessive hardware requirements. This removes bump-mapping from the 
equation given in <a href="http://www.bigpanda.com/trinity/article1.html">MATQ3GE</a>. As a subtle side effect, the light-map is now free to appear <em>later</em> in the
equation. It may be unclear what this means or why this would be important. It may help to
discuss <em>order-of-operations. </em>Let's start with ordinary arithmetic:<em></em>
</p><h2 align="center"><em>1+2*3</em></h2>
Because multiplication and division are always done before addition and subtraction, two and
three are multiplied together, and then one is added to produce <em>seven</em>. But parentheses can be
used to rearrange the <em>order-of-operations</em>:
<h2 align="center">(1+2)*3</h2>
In this case, one and two are added, and then the result is multiplied by three to produce <em>nine</em>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Multitexture can be done with <em>alpha blending</em>, <em>multiple texture units</em>, or a combination of both.
Only the best 3D cards have <em>multiple texture units</em>, so we will concentrate on techniques that
require only <em>alpha blending</em>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>Because alpha blending means blending a polygon with what's 
already on the screen, each operation is applied to the grand total of 
all previous operations. This order-of-operations doesn't care about 
multiplication coming before addition - it moves strictly from the start
 of the equation to the end, step by step. It is impossible to reorder 
the operations with well-chosen parentheses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>You can't choose the parentheses, but you can avoid confusion by wrapping everything in
parentheses like so:
</p><h2 align="center">(((((A+B)*C)+D)*E)+F)</h2>
In <a href="http://www.bigpanda.com/trinity/article1.html">MATQ3GE</a>, many layers of bump-mapping are added to one layer of light-mapping. The
result is multiplied with texture-mapping.
<h2 align="center">(((((L+B<font size="-2">1</font>)+B<font size="-2">2</font>)+B<font size="-2">3</font>)+B<font size="-2">4</font>)*T)</h2>
If the light-map and bump-maps were applied after the texture-map, the operations would not be
done in the same order, and the result would not look the same, to say the least:
<h2 align="center">(((((T*B<font size="-2">4</font>)+B<font size="-2">3</font>)+B<font size="-2">2</font>)+B<font size="-2">1</font>)+L)</h2>
But if the bump-maps are gone (as is the case with Q3A), the result is the same regardless of the
order-of-operations:
<h2 align="center">1. (L*T)</h2>
<h2 align="center">2. (T*L)</h2>
The light-map is free to come after the texture-map. Now that we've explained what this means,
let's explain why it's important.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Let's consider the specular-map. Its purpose is to add shiny highlights to the texture-map. We
can enable the specular-map in the above two equations in one of two ways:
</p><h2 align="center">1. ((L*T)+S)</h2>
<h2 align="center">2. ((T+S)*L)</h2>
The first equation shows us how the specular map was applied in <a href="http://www.bigpanda.com/trinity/article1.html">MATQ3GE</a> - by necessity,
only <em>after</em> the light-map had already applied shadows to the texture-map. The second equation
shows us how, without bump-mapping, the specular-map can be applied <em>before</em> shadows are
applied.

when specular-mapping is applied <i>after</i> light-mapping, 
the shiny parts "glow" when they enter shadow. this looks bad.

<h2 align="center">2. ((T+S)*L)</h2>
when specular-mapping is applied <i>before</i> light-mapping, 
the shiny parts are obscured by shadow. this looks good.
</td>
</tr></tbody></table></p>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This is important because shadows are <em>supposed</em> to be applied after specular highlights. If the
specular-map were to shine through shadows (as was the case in <a href="http://www.bigpanda.com/trinity/article1.html">MATQ3GE</a>), they would be
specular in bright light, but <em>emissive</em> in shadow  (note to Quakers: emissive is just a fancy way of
saying fullbright). It would not be easy to design specular-maps that look good under these
conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>For what it's worth, the above problem was contrived to help explain the kind of problems that arise
with <i>order-of-operations</i>. Many solutions do not involve tossing away bump-mapping.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>It is possible to get correct shadows and bump-mapping by combining bump-maps and specular-maps into specular-bump-maps:
</p><h2 align="center">(((((T+S<font size="-2">1</font>)+S<font size="-2">2</font>)+S<font size="-2">3</font>)+S<font size="-2">4</font>)*L)</h2>

specular-bump-mapping kills two birds with one stone.
</center><p></p>

<p>It is even possible, with the help of palettes, to combine all four specular-bump-maps into a
single super-specular-bump-map:
</p><h2 align="center">((T+S<font size="-2">1234</font>)*L)</h2><p></p>

<p>Finally, the most twisted trick of all: the four specular-bump-maps 
for each  16 bit texture-map are packed into the same two bits of four 
separate 8 bit textures. Each 8 bit texture is shared by the 
specular-bump-maps of four 16 bit texture-maps. A palette selects which 
two bits define a four-color grayscale. If polygons are sorted by 
palette, only four palette switches are needed per frame. Like usual, 
six passes are required to get texture-mapping, specular-bump-mapping 
and light-mapping, but texture memory requirements drop from 48 
bits-per-pixel to 24!</p>
